#LEGO LAND - by Corey Morehead

navigational commands - The camera moves along the x, and z axis using the
up and down arrows.The camera can rotate around the y Axis with the left or
right arrow.

When Lego Land Project runs, you should see a ferris wheel that is under
construction. Alot of geometry was used to create this ferris wheel.
This is in the center of the room. To the left of the ferris wheel, you
could see a lego construction worker, with dirt all over him. I used mutli texturing
and billboarding to show the dirty construction worker.
There is also a car racing around the ferris wheel.The car is simple geometry, with
a transpart tinted window. Along the sides of the room you will see a lego walls.
on the east side you will see that it isnt completly finished, like most lego projects.
a great bit og geometry was used on creating each block.Yo will also see a HUD
that wraps the border of the screen, I used texture mapping for this.
In the background you should also see the skybox of Andy's room from "Toy Story". I 
used cube mapping to create the sky box.

The main 4 items that I used to create my Lego Land would be, 
1. Texture Mapping
2. Blending
3. Transparency
4. Multi-Texturing
5. Cube Mapping

Some of the challenges was all the geometry that was needed to create all the blocks.
each side of each lego block was different. I tried to create a function that would
make legos, bringing in the location, color, and so on, but this didnt work. I tried
looping thru and this also didnt work, in most cases. 
I was going to shadow the ferris wheel, but due to my floor not being flat, I had alot of
issues with the shadow effect. I also had some issues with the billbord, trying to center
the image. If you look at the construction worker now, there are still angles where it looks
like he has 3 arms.
